# KPI Overview
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are a set of metrics that are used to measure the performance of a system. Calculated on a daily basis, KPIs can be used to characterize a system either at a point in time or to trend data over a longer period.

KPIs are separated into two categories: Benchmark & Contractual.

Benchmark KPIs are used to characterize a system's performance relative to itself and other projects in a user's portfolio. These KPIs are consistent across all projects. Proximal intends to provide industry-supplied values to compare an individual project or portfolio to.

Contractual KPIs are used to track the specific behavior of a system or component as defined by a contract between two parties. These KPIs are project-specific, and are created by the Proximal team individually for each project. As such, documentation for these KPIs cannot be found in these pages, but will be more thoroughly documented in the KPI page on the Proximal platform. These KPIs are not available for benchmarking against other projects, nor industry standards. They have an associated contract available to view, and typically have an incurred liquidated damages calculation as well as the liable party.
