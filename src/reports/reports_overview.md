# Reports Overview

Reports are automated, or semi-automated, studies performed by the Proximal platform which can keep you informed about the health of various aspects of the power plant.  These reports generally have intelligent data filters which can be modified by a human in the loop.

The outputs of these reports are generated so that they can be shared with internal and external stakeholders who may or may not have access to the Proximal platform.  The XLSX and CSV download features allow users to take the data generated by a report and do further manual analysis.
