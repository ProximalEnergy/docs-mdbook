# PV Model Overview

## Why Proximal

The Proximal PV performance model has been specifically designed with operating assets in mind.  The following are a few highlights of the model that distinguish it from other PV models used in asset management.

    <h3 class="feature-title">Built on Open Source</h3>
    <p class="feature-description">
        Modern, tested, transparent, trusted by the community.  By building on top of pvlib, we can ensure that the proximal energy model is understandable by all users and easily extendable.

    <h3 class="feature-title">Nodal</h3>
    <p class="feature-description">
        Expected energy can be calculated at the combiner, inverter, array, or substation level.

  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-icon">🕑</div>
    <h3 class="feature-title">Sub-Hourly</h3>
    <p class="feature-description">
        Operating assets emit high frequency data which is captured by the energy model.

  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-icon">🗺️</div>
    <h3 class="feature-title">Geospatial</h3>
    <p class="feature-description">
        Each block of the system uses the meteorological data that is closest to it which can yield great improvements for large systems with passing clouds.
    </p>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-icon">📄</div>
    <h3 class="feature-title">Documented</h3>
    <p class="feature-description">
        Each step of the model is documented in detail through pvlib and through this documentation set.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-icon">♲</div>
    <h3 class="feature-title">Efficient</h3>
    <p class="feature-description">
        Inputs to each individual model are automatically factored into unique combinations.  This makes the model capable of handling large systems with high levels of detail at high frequency possible.
