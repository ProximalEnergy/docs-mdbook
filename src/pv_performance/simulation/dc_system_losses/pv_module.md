# PV Module Definition

## Single Diode Model Parameters
The single diode model requires a set of PV module parameters.  These parameters are generally calculated at a test lab and placed inside of a .PAN file.  The Proximal platform can read data from a .PAN file or from the [CEC](https://www.energy.ca.gov/media/2367) database of pv modules.

## Other Parameters
There are other parameters that may or may not be included in the .PAN file that Proximal needs for performance modeling purposes.  These parameters may appear on a data sheet or can be found by contacting the manufacturer.

- **Warranted Degradation Rate**
- **Warranted Degradation at Year Zero**
- **Length**
- **Width**
- **Frame overhang:**  Describes the non-active PV between the PV active cell and the edge of the module frame
- **AR coating presence**
